# Memory Leak Tracking Implementation Summary

## Overview

This implementation addresses [SGLang issue #9365](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/issues/9365) by providing comprehensive memory leak tracking infrastructure. It specifically implements the two test scenarios requested in the issue comments by @mickqian.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Core Infrastructure
- **Memory Tracking Utilities**: Robust memory monitoring with optional dependencies
- **Test Framework**: Unit tests integrated with existing SGLang test infrastructure  
- **Standalone Tools**: Scripts for easy testing and monitoring

### 2. Requested Test Scenarios

#### Test 1: Text Model Memory Tracking
- **Request**: "A text model"
- **Implementation**: `test_text_model_memory_tracking()` in unit tests
- **Script**: `python scripts/run_memory_tests.py --test text-model`
- **Purpose**: Track memory usage in pure text models to establish baseline behavior

#### Test 2: VLM Without MM Processor
- **Request**: "A VLM without initializing mm_processor"  
- **Implementation**: `test_vlm_without_mm_processor_memory_tracking()` in unit tests
- **Script**: `python scripts/run_memory_tests.py --test vlm-no-mm-processor`
- **Purpose**: Test VLM server with text-only requests (no image processing)

### 3. Additional Reference Test
- **VLM with Image Processing**: Demonstrates the memory leak issue described in #9365
- **Script**: `python scripts/run_memory_tests.py --test vlm-with-images`

## Key Features

### Graceful Dependency Handling
- Works with or without optional dependencies (matplotlib, GPUtil, psutil, torch)
- Continues functionality even when dependencies are missing
- Clear warnings about missing features

### Comprehensive Output
- Real-time memory usage statistics
- JSON data export for analysis
- Optional memory usage plots
- Console logging with progress indicators

### Easy Integration
- Compatible with existing SGLang test infrastructure
- Can be run standalone or as part of CI/CD
- Follows SGLang testing patterns and conventions

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Quick validation
python scripts/validate_memory_infrastructure.py

# Test text model (addresses comment request #1)
python scripts/run_memory_tests.py --test text-model

# Test VLM without mm_processor (addresses comment request #2)
python scripts/run_memory_tests.py --test vlm-no-mm-processor

# Run all tests
python scripts/run_memory_tests.py --test all

# Advanced monitoring
python scripts/memory_leak_monitor.py \
    --model meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct \
    --test-type text \
    --num-requests 100
```

## Expected Behavior

### Text Model Test
- **Expected**: Stable memory usage with minimal growth
- **Indicates Issue**: Continuous memory growth over requests
- **Threshold**: Growth > 100MB over 100 requests suggests problem

### VLM Without MM Processor Test  
- **Expected**: Similar to text model but higher baseline memory
- **Purpose**: Isolate whether leaks are in LLM component vs image processing
- **Comparison**: Should behave similarly to text-only model

### VLM With Images Test
- **Expected**: May show memory growth as described in issue #9365
- **Purpose**: Reference test to demonstrate the known issue
- **Analysis**: Compare with VLM text-only to isolate image processing impact

## Integration with Issue Tracking

This implementation provides the experimental infrastructure mentioned in issue #9365:
- Reproduces the memory leak scenarios described
- Provides data collection for analysis
- Enables systematic testing of fixes
- Supports the ongoing investigation into OOM issues

## Future Enhancements

The infrastructure is designed to be extensible:
- Additional model types can be easily added
- More sophisticated memory analysis can be integrated
- CI/CD integration for automated leak detection
- Performance regression testing capabilities

## Validation

All components have been validated:
- ✅ Basic functionality works without dependencies
- ✅ Scripts are accessible and show proper help
- ✅ Documentation is complete and accessible
- ✅ Unit tests run successfully
- ✅ Memory tracking captures data correctly

This implementation directly addresses the requests in issue #9365 and provides a solid foundation for ongoing memory leak investigation and resolution.
