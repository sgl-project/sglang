# Sliding Window Attention Capability Matrix

This folder covers dense attention with a finite `sliding_window_size`.
Expected outputs use the dense HF-style PyTorch reference with sliding-window
masking, not a second backend call. The SWA fixture is the dense fixture
reused with `sliding_window_size != None`.

## Coverage Matrix

Columns are runner modes; rows are attention backends. Cells use:
- **✓ \<variants\>** — exercised, with the config variants listed in the cell
- **—** — not applicable (no production path for this combination)
- **blocked: \<reason\>** — production-unsupported, not a follow-up
- **deferred: \<reason\>** — could land later, currently disabled

## Input And Config Coverage

- No-prefix lengths below / equal / above the configured `sliding_window_size`.
- For `triton`: matching prefix-length cases.
- For `torch_native`: extra MHA + GQA decode cases at the window edge.
- CG decode covers both within-window (`min(seq_lens, window)` clipped) and
  above-window (full window clip) for `triton`.

## Notes on the "—" cells

- **`torch_native` graph rows** — same as dense: no CUDA-graph capture/replay
  hooks (`base_attn_backend.py:24-55` raises `NotImplementedError`).
- **SWA-only methods** — DSV4 SWA, DSA dense fallback, and other SWA-shaped
  paths live in their own folders. This folder is strictly the dense MHA/GQA
  backend with a finite window.

## Mutation Coverage Notes

- The CG-decode above-window case (`runner_cuda_graph_swa_decode_above_window`)
  exists specifically to expose the `sliding_window_size + 1` mutation at
  `triton_backend.py:786` (M5). The dense reference picks the matching SWA mask
  rule based on `case.backend in _SWA_AWARE_DECODE_BACKENDS` and
  `case.forward_mode.is_decode()`.
- The Verify CG above-window case
  (`runner_cuda_graph_eagle_verify_swa_above_window`) extends above-window
  coverage to the verify replay path, but does not catch M6 by itself — the
  extend kernel re-masks `kv_id >= q_id - sliding_window_size` so the +1 shift
  the mutation introduces is dropped. See `MUTATION_FIXES.md`.

## Production-Unsupported

- **FlashInfer SWA `TARGET_VERIFY` / `DRAFT_EXTEND`** — the SWA prefill updater
  (`FlashInferIndicesUpdaterPrefill.update_sliding_window`,
  `flashinfer_backend.py:1296-1344`) requires non-`None` `prefix_lens`. The
  target-verify and draft-extend code paths pass `prefix_lens=None` at
  `flashinfer_backend.py:742,754`, so the SWA prefill kernel cannot be reached
  without a separate fix to the prefill metadata contract.
- **`torch_native` SWA speculative / CUDA graph** — no CG hooks; all graph
  integration is structurally unsupported.

## Next Work

- Investigate the Triton above-window decode/reference numerical detail
  separately (the above-window case currently asserts within tolerance with the
  matching reference rule; if a real backend regression appears, lower the
  tolerance).
- FlashInfer SWA verify path would need a new metadata contract that threads
  `prefix_lens` through the target-verify replay; until that lands the fixture
  is intentionally inactive.
