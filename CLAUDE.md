## How To Use Pensieve

Use `.pensieve/` as the first source of architectural intent.

- `maxims/` are active engineering rules.
- `decisions/` are active project decisions.
- `knowledge/` explains boundary maps and debugging paths.
- `pipelines/` gives executable workflows.

Use these project pipelines directly when trigger words match; do not rediscover them through skills first.

- Commit requests (`commit`, `git commit`): use `.pensieve/pipelines/run-when-committing.md`. Check staged diff, decide whether reusable insight should be captured, then make atomic commits.
- Refactor requests (`refactor`, `large refactor`, `split code`): use `.pensieve/pipelines/run-when-refactoring.md`. Confirm the real problem, fix upstream data authority first, split large work into 2-3 user-visible steps, delete old paths when new paths work, and avoid compatibility/fallback branches.
- Review requests (`review`, `code review`, `inspect code`): use `.pensieve/pipelines/run-when-reviewing-code.md`. Start from git history and changed hot spots, verify candidate issues, and report only high-signal findings with evidence and file locations.
