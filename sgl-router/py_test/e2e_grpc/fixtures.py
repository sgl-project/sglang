"""
Fixtures for launching gRPC router + workers for e2e testing.

This module provides fixtures for launching SGLang workers and gRPC router separately:
    1. Launch N SGLang workers with gRPC enabled
    2. Launch router pointing to those workers

This approach gives more control and matches production deployment patterns.

    Launch SGLang workers and gRPC router separately.

    This approach:
    1. Starts N SGLang workers with --grpc-mode flag
    2. Waits for workers to initialize (process startup)

    4. Waits for router health check to pass (router validates worker connectivity)
