# RL and Training Framework Integrations

SGLang integrates with popular RL and training frameworks for efficient fine-tuning and alignment.

> **📘 Looking for detailed integration guides?** Some frameworks provide dedicated SGLang integration documentation (like [Unsloth's guide](https://docs.unsloth.ai/basics/inference-and-deployment/sglang-guide)). Check each framework's documentation for detailed setup instructions. Framework maintainers: we welcome contributions of dedicated integration guides!

## MILES

**GitHub**: https://github.com/radixark/miles  
**Blog**: https://lmsys.org/blog/2025-11-19-miles/

MILES is an enterprise-facing reinforcement learning framework for large-scale MoE post-training. Born from slime, MILES focuses on new hardware support (GB200+), stable RL for large MoE models, and production-grade features.

### Key Features
- **SGLang-native**: Built for high-performance training with SGLang rollout backend
- **Deterministic training**: Zero mismatch between training and inference
- **Speculative training**: 25%+ rollout speedup with online draft model training
- **Production-ready**: Graceful OOM handling, memory optimization, FSDP improvements

### Integration with SGLang

MILES natively integrates SGLang for the rollout subsystem. All SGLang server arguments can be passed with the `--sglang-` prefix:

```bash
# Example: Launch MILES training with SGLang
python train.py \
  --tensor-model-parallel-size 2 \
  --sglang-mem-fraction-static 0.85 \
  --sglang-port 30000
```

Arguments like `--mem-fraction-static`, `--tp`, `--max-running-requests` become `--sglang-mem-fraction-static`, `--sglang-tp`, etc.

python train.py \
  --tensor-model-parallel-size 4 \
  --sglang-mem-fraction-static 0.8 \
  --sglang-port 30000
```

```bash
# Install VERL with SGLang support
git clone https://github.com/volcengine/verl.git
cd verl
pip install -e .[sglang]
```

Configure your training script to use SGLang for inference during rollout generation.

## AReaL

**GitHub**: https://github.com/inclusionAI/AReaL  
**Paper**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24298

AReaL is a fully asynchronous RL system that decouples generation from training. Achieves up to 2.77x training speedup with state-of-the-art results on math and code reasoning.

### Key Features
- **Fully asynchronous**: Continuous generation without waiting for training
- **SGLang backend**: Uses SGLang v0.4.0+ for efficient rollout generation
- **High performance**: 2.77x speedup vs synchronous systems

### Integration with SGLang

AReaL v0.2.0+ uses SGLang as the generation backend, leveraging RadixAttention for improved throughput:

```python
# AReaL automatically uses SGLang for rollout generation
# Configure in your training script
python -m areal.launcher.local \
  examples/math/gsm8k_grpo.py \
  --config examples/math/gsm8k_grpo.yaml
```

# 1. Train with Unsloth
from unsloth import FastLanguageModel
model, tokenizer = FastLanguageModel.from_pretrained(
    model_name="meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct",
    max_seq_length=2048,

# ... training code ...
model.save_pretrained("output_model")

```bash
# 1. Train with LLaMAFactory

```

## General Integration Pattern

Most training frameworks can integrate with SGLang by:

1. **Launch SGLang server** for inference:
```bash
python -m sglang.launch_server \
  --model-path <your-model> \
  --port 30000 \
  --tp <num-gpus>
```

2. **Configure framework** to use `http://localhost:30000` as the inference endpoint

3. **For native integrations** (MILES, slime, VERL, AReaL): Use framework-specific configuration to enable SGLang
