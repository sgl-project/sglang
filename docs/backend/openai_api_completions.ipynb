    "You can use `chat_template_kwargs` to enable or disable the model's internal thinking or reasoning process output. Set `\"enable_thinking\": True` within `chat_template_kwargs` to include the reasoning steps in the response. This requires launching the server with a compatible reasoning parser (e.g., `--reasoning-parser qwen3` for Qwen3 models).\n",
