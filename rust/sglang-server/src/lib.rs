//! sglang-server: a multi-threaded Rust frontend (API server → TokenizerManager
//! → Tokenizer/Detokenizer) embedded in the Python scheduler process.
//!
//! Pipeline stages 1–5 are pure Rust and never touch a `PyObject`, so they run
//! concurrently with the Python scheduler without contending for the GIL. The
//! only GIL crossings are the boundary methods on [`Server`]:
//!   * `recv_requests` — Python scheduler thread drains the ingress ring.
//!   * `push_batch`    — Python scheduler thread pushes one output batch.
//!   * `push_result`   — Python scheduler thread pushes one control result.
//!
//! All are non-blocking, so the GIL is never held across a wait.
#![allow(dead_code)] // TODO: remove when the consumer PR lands
