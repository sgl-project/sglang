# sglang-server

`sglang-server` is SGLang's Rust HTTP frontend and request-processing pipeline. It exchanges typed requests and responses with the Python scheduler while keeping latency-sensitive work outside Python.

## Code review principles

1. **Use strongly typed boundaries.** Model every supported protocol shape with structs, enums, and validated newtypes; avoid opaque values such as `serde_json::Value` and `rmpv::Value` in production paths.
2. **Keep one canonical schema.** Rust and Python must derive their wire contracts from one source of truth, aligned with `io_struct.py`, instead of independently duplicating field names, order, defaults, or validation.
3. **Make protocol declarations minimal and declarative.** A reviewer should be able to understand the wire format from its type declarations alone, without tracing fillers, conversion code, macros, or repeated field lists.
4. **Use one representation per semantic stage.** Separate external input, normalized domain data, and wire data, and convert between them once at explicit boundaries; do not keep multiple overlapping representations of the same state.
5. **Design compatibility and safety explicitly.** Version protocols, reject unsupported or malformed inputs clearly, validate lengths and resource bounds before allocation, preserve invariants in types, and test compatibility across the real Rust and Python codecs.
