Utilities for multi-modal models.

This python file mainly contains utilities that were used in the
image processing logic of llava-next including operations such as
anyres and anyres_max

Currently supports the anyres and anyres_max operation for CLIP and
SigLip. For more information, you may refer to the paper or the blog
