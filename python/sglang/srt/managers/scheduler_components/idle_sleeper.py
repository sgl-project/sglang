    In setups which have long inactivity periods it is desirable to reduce
    system power consumption when sglang does nothing. This would lead not only
    to power savings, but also to more CPU thermal headroom when a request
    eventually comes. This is important in cases when multiple GPUs are connected
    as each GPU would otherwise pin one thread at 100% CPU usage.

    The simplest solution is to use zmq.Poller on all sockets that may receive
    data that needs handling immediately.
