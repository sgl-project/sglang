class WorkflowBase(ABC):
    """
    Abstract base class for defining video processing workflows.

    A workflow serves as the top-level orchestrator that coordinates multiple pipelines
    and components to accomplish a specific video processing task. The workflow pattern
    provides several key benefits:

    1. **Separation of Concerns**: Workflows separate high-level orchestration logic
       from low-level processing implementations in pipelines.

    2. **Modularity**: Different workflows can be created for different execution modes
       (preprocess, inference, etc.) while sharing common pipeline components.

    3. **Configuration Management**: Workflows manage the configuration and initialization
       of multiple related pipelines and components in a centralized manner.

    4. **Environment Setup**: Workflows handle system-level setup and resource
       allocation before pipeline execution begins.

    5. **Lifecycle Management**: Workflows control the complete lifecycle from
       initialization through execution to cleanup.

    The workflow acts as a factory and coordinator, creating the appropriate pipelines
    based on configuration, setting up the execution environment, and orchestrating
    the overall processing flow.
