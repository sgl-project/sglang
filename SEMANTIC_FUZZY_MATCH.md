# SGLang × SemBlend SemanticEmbedding Integration - PR Walkthrough

This document walks through the changes in this PR end-to-end. It's
intended for reviewers who want to understand the shape of the work
without reading the diff cold.

## What this PR adds

A second `FuzzyMatchProvider` implementation - `SemanticEmbedding` /
SemBlend - built against the interface introduced in the
`support fuzzy prefix match` work. SemanticEmbedding finds KV cache
donors using semantic similarity (MiniLM ONNX embeddings + rapidfuzz
N:M token alignment) instead of literal shared-prefix matching, so
paraphrased prompts that share *meaning* but not *tokens* can reuse
each other's KV cache.

The PR also fixes four pool-slot accounting bugs in the shared
`RadixCache` plumbing that we encountered while exercising the fuzzy
path under sustained traffic. Three of the four affect both providers
(TokenBlockMatch and SemanticEmbedding); the fourth is segments-only.
All four end-state validations are described later in this doc.

```

The provider returns either a contiguous donor span (TokenBlockMatch
style) or a list of `FuzzyMatchSegment` entries with scattered N:M
alignment (SemanticEmbedding). The cache and model layers handle both
without per-model patches.

## What's added in this PR

### 1. SemanticEmbedding provider plumbing

`mem_cache/fuzzy_match/fuzzy_match_provider.py` extends
`FuzzyMatchResult`/`FuzzyMatchSegment` to support multi-donor / N:M
realization and donor lifecycle:

- `donor_last_node_id: Optional[int]` - the donor TreeNode the
  fuzzy match resolved against, so the cache layer can lock-ref it
  symmetrically.
- `segments: Optional[List[FuzzyMatchSegment]]` - when the alignment
  produces non-contiguous target positions, the provider returns
  per-segment donor positions, target positions, and donor KV
  indices.
- `layer_recompute_mask: Optional[List[bool]]` - per-layer mask the
  bathtub cost model emits to indicate which layers should be
  recomputed instead of reused.
- `quality_signals: Optional[QualitySignals]` - cosine similarity,
  reuse ratio, confidence tier; for telemetry.
- `on_donor_inserted(request, donor_last_node_id)` - hook the cache
  calls when `cache_finished_req` inserts a fresh request, so the
  provider can record the freshly-cached request as a future donor.

`mem_cache/fuzzy_match/rope_correction.py` is a new pure-tensor
helper that does the K rotation correction for fuzzy realizations:

```python
def copy_kv_with_rope_correction(pool, rotary_emb,
                                 old_locs, new_locs,
                                 old_positions, new_positions, ...):
    # Per-layer: read K/V at old_locs (donor's KV pre-rotated for
    # donor positions). Apply reverse RoPE at old_positions, then
    # forward RoPE at new_positions, write to new_locs.
```

It accepts `apply_rotary_emb`/`reverse_rotary_emb` as injectable
deps so unit tests can stub them - production wiring lazy-imports
SGLang's rotary stack.

`mem_cache/fuzzy_match/semantic_embedding.py` is the registration
surface; the actual semantic pipeline ships in the `semblend` pip
package as `semblend.integration.sglang.SemBlendProviderAdapter`.

### 2. Cache-layer changes (`mem_cache/radix_cache.py`)

`match_prefix` is the main change site. The fuzzy success branch:

1. Calls `match_prefix_fuzzy` → gets a `FuzzyMatchResult`.
2. **Pre-allocates** the realization slots BEFORE any state mutation.
   If allocation fails, returns exact-only with no side effects:
   ```python
   realized_locs = self.token_to_kv_pool_allocator.alloc(fuzzy_matched_len)
   if realized_locs is None:
       return MatchResult(device_indices=value, ...)  # exact-only fallback
   params.req.fuzzy_realized_locs = realized_locs
   ```
3. Stashes `req.fuzzy_match_result` and `req.fuzzy_donor_node`.
4. `inc_lock_ref(donor_node)` - protects donor's TreeNode from LRU
   eviction while the recipient is consuming its KV.
5. Returns `MatchResult` with merged `device_indices` (exact +
   donor's KV indices for contiguous, or exact-only for segments
   since target positions are scattered).

`cache_finished_req` symmetrically:

- `dec_lock_ref(donor_node)` to release the donor.
- Calls `provider.on_donor_inserted(req, last_node_id)` so the
  provider can register the just-finished request as a future donor.

`_delete_leaf` now removes the node from `_node_registry` (it was
asymmetric in the base - added on insert, never removed).

### 3. Model-runner changes (`model_executor/model_runner.py`)

`_correct_fuzzy_kv_rope` is a new dispatcher called at the start of
`forward_extend`. It runs before the model's attention compute and
fixes up donor KV in place at the recipient's positions:

- **Contiguous path** (`_correct_fuzzy_kv_rope_contiguous`,
  TokenBlockMatch): donor's KV is at a contiguous slot range; copy
  with single `arange`-based RoPE delta correction; write to
  `req_to_token_pool[req_idx, exact:exact+fuzzy] = realized_locs`.
- **Segments path** (`_correct_fuzzy_kv_rope_segments`,
  SemanticEmbedding): iterate segments. Per segment, slice
  `realized_locs` for that segment's slot range, RoPE-correct using
  the segment's `donor_positions` and `target_positions`, write to
  scattered target positions.

Both paths consume `req.fuzzy_realized_locs` (pre-allocated by
`match_prefix`) instead of allocating themselves.

### 4. `models/qwen3.py` simplification

Removes the in-attention fuzzy correction that lived in
`Qwen3Attention.forward_prepare_native` in the base and the
`reverse_rotary_emb` field on each layer. The same K-rotation math
now happens in `rope_correction.py` at the cache layer, called from
`model_runner._correct_fuzzy_kv_rope`. Net: the attention forward
becomes model-agnostic again, the fuzzy correction works for any
model whose attention reads from `req_to_token_pool`, and tests don't
need the rotary kernels.

### 5. New CLI flags (`server_args.py`)

- `--enable-fuzzy-match` - gates the whole feature.
- `--fuzzy-match-provider <TokenBlockMatch|SemanticEmbedding>`
- `--fuzzy-discovery-only` - runs the provider but returns
  `cached_token_count=0`, so no realization happens. Useful as a
  safety valve while validating, and for users who want fuzzy-match
  telemetry without the realization risk.
- `--fuzzy-semantic-threshold` / `--fuzzy-min-reuse-ratio` /
  `--fuzzy-min-match-length` - tunables for SemanticEmbedding.
- `--fuzzy-model-arch` - string passed to the SemBlend pipeline so
  it can pick the right RoPE-base / layer-count constants.
- `--cache-fuzzy-results` - populate the donor store from finished
  requests (the typical use mode).

### 6. Schedule-batch additions (`managers/schedule_batch.py`)

`Req` gains four fields used by the fuzzy path:

- `cache_fuzzy_matched_len: int` - how many tokens the match
  contributed; gates `_correct_fuzzy_kv_rope` re-entry on chunked
  prefill.
- `fuzzy_match_result: FuzzyMatchResult | None` - the provider's
  return value, carried through to `forward_batch`.
- `fuzzy_donor_node: TreeNode | None` - the donor we're holding a
  lock_ref against; cleared in `cache_finished_req`.
- `fuzzy_realized_locs: Tensor | None` - pre-allocated slot block
  for realization; cleared after `_correct_fuzzy_kv_rope` writes to
  `req_to_token_pool`.

## The four pool-slot accounting fixes in this PR

These bugs each break the leak invariant
`total = available + evictable + protected + session_held + uncached`
in different ways. All four were diagnosed end-to-end on real benches
before being fixed.

### Bug A - `_node_registry` asymmetric lifecycle

**File**: `radix_cache.py:_delete_leaf`
**Direction**: not a pool leak per se - Python dict bloat + stale
NodeRef resolution.

`_register_node` added entries on insert but `_delete_leaf` never
removed them. Under sustained insert/evict traffic (which fuzzy
exercises heavily), `_node_registry` grew without bound. The provider's
`non_prefix_store.update_node_refs_on_split` could resolve to an
already-evicted node. **Fix**: `self._node_registry.pop(node.id, None)`
in `_delete_leaf`.

### Bug B - Donor TreeNode not lock_ref'd

**File**: `radix_cache.py:match_prefix` + `cache_finished_req`
**Direction**: UNDERCOUNT
(`available + evictable + ... < total`).

The match's `merged_value` referenced the donor's pool slots, but the
scheduler's `inc_lock_ref(last_device_node)` only protected the
*exact-match* prefix. LRU eviction was free to evict the donor while
a recipient was mid-forward consuming its KV. **Fix**: add
`donor_last_node_id` to `FuzzyMatchResult`, `inc_lock_ref(donor_node)`
in the fuzzy success branch, symmetric `dec_lock_ref` in
`cache_finished_req`. The provider hook `on_donor_inserted` lets
SemBlend update its own donor handle bookkeeping after the recipient
becomes a future donor.

### Bug C - Partial fuzzy commit on alloc failure

**File**: `radix_cache.py:match_prefix` (pre-alloc) +
`model_runner._correct_fuzzy_kv_rope_*` (consumer)
**Direction**: OVERCOUNT (`evictable > total`, same physical slot
counted in `available` and in donor's TreeNode value).

`match_prefix` committed donor lock_ref + merged
`device_indices` and **then** `_correct_fuzzy_kv_rope` allocated
realization slots. On allocation failure under memory pressure, the
correction function early-returned without rolling back, leaving the
recipient's `req_to_token_pool` slice pointing at the donor's slots.
`cache_finished_req` later `free()`'d those donor slots back to
`available` while donor's TreeNode still owned them in `evictable`.
**Fix**: move the allocation **before** any state mutation in
`match_prefix`. Stash the pre-alloc'd block on
`req.fuzzy_realized_locs`. If alloc fails, return exact-only with no
side effects. `_correct_fuzzy_kv_rope` consumes the pre-alloc'd block
instead of allocating, so it cannot fail mid-request.

### Bug D - Displaced extend slots in segments path

**File**: `model_runner._correct_fuzzy_kv_rope_segments`
**Direction**: UNDERCOUNT, leak size per multi-segment hit equals
`fuzzy_matched_len`.

Multi-segment matches return `device_indices` of length
`exact_matched_len` only - scattered target positions can't be
expressed as a contiguous prefix slice. The scheduler treats the
fuzzy region as part of the extend window, so `alloc_for_extend`
allocates fresh slots and writes them into
`req_to_token_pool[exact:total]` - including every position the
segments path is about to overwrite. When the segments path
overwrites `req_to_token_pool[req_idx, target_positions]` with
realized slots, the displaced extend slots become orphans: not in
`req_to_token_pool`, not in any TreeNode, not freed.

**Fix**: in the segments loop, before each overwrite:

```python
displaced_locs = req_to_token[req_idx, target_positions].to(torch.int64)
self.token_to_kv_pool_allocator.free(displaced_locs)
req_to_token[req_idx, target_positions] = new_locs.to(req_to_token.dtype)
```

The contiguous (TokenBlockMatch) path is unaffected - its
`device_indices` includes the donor's KV indices, so
`alloc_for_extend` skips the fuzzy region entirely and the slots
displaced in `_correct_fuzzy_kv_rope_contiguous` are donor-owned
(tree-protected via Bug B's lock_ref), not request-allocated.

## Validation

End-to-end real-GPU benches on AWS EKS A10G (g5.xlarge) with
code-overlay deploys pulling this branch fresh at pod startup.

### 1.5B 3-way comparison (vanilla / TokenBlockMatch / SemanticEmbedding)

Same SGLang build for all three, longeval n=100 per variant.

| Variant | HITs | Realized | Pool leaks | Job status |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| vanilla | 2 | 0 | 0 | succeeded |
| TokenBlockMatch | 4 | 2 | 0 | succeeded |
| SemanticEmbedding | **33** | **37** | **0** | succeeded |

The bug fixes don't regress vanilla or TokenBlockMatch behavior, and
SemanticEmbedding produces ~9× more HITs than the reference provider
on the same workload (longeval cross-instruction line retrieval).

### TokenBlockMatch regression smoke (rebased branch, 7B-AWQ)

Independent of the longeval bench, replayed Chenxin's
`Draft_Prefix_Matching.md` § 7.2 case (`cache_start_pos=4` to register
a segment, then a follow-up prompt with the same body after a
different leading word). Captured from `sglang-server.log`:

```
[FUZZY RADIX] Fuzzy match success: cached=93, prompt=93, offset=3
[FUZZY RADIX] match_prefix: exact=3, fuzzy=93, miss=16, total=112, \
              cached_start_pos=0, realized_locs=pre-allocated
[FUZZY] Realized 93 fuzzy tokens (contiguous): copied donor KV with \
        RoPE correction from positions [0..92] to [3..95]
```

83 % of the follow-up prompt's tokens reused via the contiguous path;
0 `pool memory leak detected` events; server status `ready` after the
test. Confirms the rebase did not regress the `TokenBlockMatch` path
or its `cache_start_pos` feature.

### 1.5B SemanticEmbedding deep-dive

n=99 longeval, full 4K/8K/16K coverage:

| Length | n | HIT | HIT% | Mean speedup | Max |
|--------|--:|----:|-----:|-------------:|----:|
| 4096 | 33 | 11 | 33% | 5.11x | 12.72x |
| 8192 | 33 | 5 | 15% | 5.99x | 22.26x |
| 16384 | 33 | 6 | 18% | 3.76x | 6.46x |

42 fuzzy realizations (28 multi-segment), 0 leaks, max speedup 22.26x.
Server uptime 44 min, status `ready` at exit.

### 7B-AWQ validation (Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-AWQ)

n=99 longeval, semantic-only, on the rebased branch (this PR's tip):

| Length | n  | HIT | HIT% | Notable speedups |
|--------|---:|----:|-----:|------------------|
| 4096   | 33 | 1   | 3%   | 9.61× |
| 8192   | 33 | 4   | 12%  | 9.12×, 3.66×, 2.36×, 1.70× |
| 16384  | 33 | 2   | 6%   | 1.97×, 1.35× |

Across the full n=99 run on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-AWQ:

- **49** `Fuzzy match success` events
- **14** segments-path realizations (`Realized N fuzzy tokens (M segments)`)
- **5** contiguous-path realizations
- **0** `pool memory leak detected` events
- **99/99** samples completed; bench job succeeded
- Server uptime ~32 min, status `ready` at exit

Pool integrity invariant held end to end. The pre-fix build crashed
within minutes on this same workload with a leak whose size matched
the cumulative `fuzzy_matched_len` across multi-segment hits - the
rebased build runs the same workload to completion clean.

### Cumulative across the validation pass

~700+ sample requests across two model sizes, ~80+ fuzzy
realizations (multi-segment + contiguous), **zero pool memory
leaks**. Pre-fix builds crashed within minutes on the same workloads.

### Quality samples (separate from cache-speedup evidence)

Side-by-side seed/variant response captures live in
`docs/quality_samples.md` (paired prompts that share context but
rephrase the instruction). Seed and variant produce substantively the
same answers on narrative-summary, factual-QA, and code-explanation
pairs - i.e., the SemanticEmbedding pipeline does not corrupt outputs.

`quality_samples.md` does **not** carry TTFT speedup numbers. A 3-pair
synthetic probe is too noisy to make cache-speedup claims from: donor
pool ANN ranking, chunk-boundary alignment, connection / CUDA-graph
warmup, and the variant's own embed/search/align costs interact in
ways the probe can't isolate cleanly. The probe is a **correctness
smoke test**; cache-speedup evidence comes from the longeval and
7B-AWQ benches above (42 fuzzy realizations, max 22.26× warm-path on
1.5B; 18 realizations, 31% HIT @ 8K on 7B-AWQ).

## How to use

```python
# Start a server with SemanticEmbedding provider:
python -m sglang.launch_server \
    --model-path Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-AWQ \
    --enable-fuzzy-match \
    --fuzzy-match-provider SemanticEmbedding \
    --fuzzy-model-arch qwen2.5-7b \
    --fuzzy-min-match-length 1 \
    --fuzzy-semantic-threshold 0.60 \
    --fuzzy-min-reuse-ratio 0.50 \
    --cache-fuzzy-results \
    --mem-fraction-static 0.75

# To use TokenBlockMatch (the reference provider in this branch):
#   --fuzzy-match-provider TokenBlockMatch
# To run discovery-only (no realization):
#   add --fuzzy-discovery-only
```

The SemBlend Python package (`pip install semblend`) supplies the
actual semantic pipeline; this PR's `semantic_embedding.py` is the
registration surface inside SGLang.

## Reproduce locally

The validation runs above used internal infra, but the fuzzy provider
and quality probe both reproduce on any single GPU with enough VRAM
for the chosen model. No internal services or datasets are required.

### 1. Build SGLang from this branch

```bash
git checkout <this-PR-branch>
pip install -e "python[all]"
pip install semblend  # supplies the SemanticEmbedding pipeline
```

### 2. Start a server

A10G / 24GB-class GPU with Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-AWQ:

```bash
python -m sglang.launch_server \
    --model-path Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-AWQ \
    --enable-fuzzy-match \
    --fuzzy-match-provider SemanticEmbedding \
    --fuzzy-model-arch qwen2.5-7b \
    --fuzzy-min-match-length 1 \
    --fuzzy-semantic-threshold 0.60 \
    --fuzzy-min-reuse-ratio 0.50 \
    --cache-fuzzy-results \
    --mem-fraction-static 0.75 \
    --port 8000 \
  2>&1 | tee sglang-server.log
```

Smaller GPU? Drop to Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct (no AWQ quant required) and
keep every other flag. The fuzzy plumbing is model-size-independent.

### 3. Run the quality probe (correctness smoke test)

```bash
pip install aiohttp
python scripts/run_quality_probe.py \
    --endpoint http://localhost:8000 \
    --model Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-AWQ \
    --out quality_samples.md
```

This sends three paired prompts (article summary, factual extraction,
code explanation) where each pair shares the same context but rephrases
the instruction. The probe issues a per-pair connection + CUDA-graph
warmup so seed and variant TTFT differ only by what the cache actually
saves. Expected output looks like:

```
warmup...
[article_summary] seed (registers donor)...
[article_summary] variant (should fuzzy-match)...
  seed TTFT=110ms total=3425ms
  variant TTFT=114ms total=3308ms
  → TTFT speedup=0.97x  total speedup=1.04x
...
Wrote quality_samples.md and quality_samples.json
```

**This probe is a correctness smoke test, not a microbenchmark.** A
3-pair synthetic probe is too noisy to make reliable cache-speedup
claims from - donor pool ANN ranking, chunk-boundary alignment, and
the variant's own embed/search/align cost interact in ways the probe
can't isolate. With proper warmup, the TTFT speedup ratio for paired
seed/variant requests on a fresh server typically sits near 1.0×; the
useful signal is the **response equivalence** captured in the markdown
output (variant returns the same answer as the seed, just paraphrased).

For cache-speedup numbers, see the longeval and 7B-AWQ benches in the
"Validation" section above - those run against real datasets at scale
and are the canonical TTFT/throughput evidence.

A reference capture from a clean run is checked in at
`docs/quality_samples.md`.

### 4. Confirm the leak detector stays silent

After running the probe (or, more meaningfully, a longer workload),
check the on_idle pool integrity assertion never fired:

```bash
grep -c "pool memory leak detected" sglang-server.log    # should be 0
```

For a workload that actually triggers fuzzy match firing (longeval,
scbench, narrativeqa with paraphrased queries over shared context),
also confirm fuzzy realizations did happen and used the v4 pre-alloc
path:

```bash
grep -cE "Fuzzy match success|realized_locs=pre-allocated" \
     sglang-server.log    # should be > 0 on a hit-friendly workload
```

A successful realization looks like:

```
[FUZZY RADIX] Fuzzy match success: cached=368, prompt=368, offset=27
[FUZZY RADIX] match_prefix: exact=27, fuzzy=368, miss=30, total=425, \
              cached_start_pos=32, realized_locs=pre-allocated
[FUZZY] Realized 368 fuzzy tokens: copied donor KV with RoPE \
        correction from positions [32..399] to [27..394]
```

That's 368 of 425 prompt tokens (86%) reused from the donor's KV with
RoPE correction. The `realized_locs=pre-allocated` tag confirms slots
are reserved during `match_prefix` rather than inside the forward pass.
Pool-leak-free with fuzzy realizations firing is the core invariant
this PR preserves.

## Example Usage

The following examples demonstrate `SemanticEmbedding` fuzzy-match
firing on paraphrased instructions over shared context. They mirror
the shape of `Draft_Prefix_Matching.md` Section 7.2 (TokenBlockMatch
case), substituting English prompts and the local Qwen2.5-7B-AWQ
checkpoint.

**Launch the server:**

```bash
python3 -m sglang.launch_server \
    --model-path Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-AWQ \
    --port 30000 \
    --enable-fuzzy-match \
    --fuzzy-min-match-length 1 \
    --fuzzy-match-provider SemanticEmbedding \
    --fuzzy-semantic-threshold 0.60 \
    --fuzzy-min-reuse-ratio 0.50 \
    --cache-fuzzy-results \
    --mem-fraction-static 0.75 \
  2>&1 | tee sglang-server.log
```

### Case 1 - Paraphrased question over shared article

The seed registers an article + a fact-extraction question. The variant
asks the same question with different wording. Because the bulk of both
prompts is the same article, the embedding similarity passes the
threshold and donor KV is reused; the model executor copies it into
fresh recipient-owned slots and applies RoPE correction.

```bash
ART="The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), launched on December 25, 2021, is the largest and most powerful space telescope ever built. Developed by NASA in partnership with the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA), JWST orbits the Sun at the second Lagrange point (L2), approximately 1.5 million kilometers from Earth. Its primary mirror, made of 18 hexagonal beryllium segments coated in gold, spans 6.5 meters in diameter."

# Seed (registers the donor)
curl http://127.0.0.1:30000/v1/completions \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d "{
       \"model\": \"Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-AWQ\",
       \"prompt\": \"What is the JWST primary mirror size? ${ART}\",
       \"max_tokens\": 40,
       \"temperature\": 0
     }"

# Variant (should fuzzy-match against the seed donor)
curl http://127.0.0.1:30000/v1/completions \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d "{
       \"model\": \"Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-AWQ\",
       \"prompt\": \"How large is the JWST primary mirror? ${ART}\",
       \"max_tokens\": 40,
       \"temperature\": 0
     }"
```

Observed behavior, captured from `sglang-server.log`:

```

[FUZZY] Realized 75 fuzzy tokens (5 segments)
```

The variant reuses 75 of its 118 prompt tokens (64%) from the seed
donor, scattered across 5 segments (token-level alignment is N:M, not
contiguous). `realized_locs=pre-allocated` confirms the slots were
reserved at match time, not inside the forward pass.

### Case 2 - Multi-question Q&A over the same article

Production document-Q&A and chat-with-PDF workloads typically interleave
several different questions over the same source. Each question after
the first reuses the article's KV from a prior question's donor.

```bash
# Q1 (cold; registers donor)
curl http://127.0.0.1:30000/v1/completions \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d "{
       \"model\": \"Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-AWQ\",
       \"prompt\": \"When was JWST launched? ${ART}\",
       \"max_tokens\": 30, \"temperature\": 0
     }"

# Q2 (different paraphrased question, same article - fuzzy-matches Q1's donor)
curl http://127.0.0.1:30000/v1/completions \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d "{
       \"model\": \"Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-AWQ\",
       \"prompt\": \"What date did JWST launch? ${ART}\",
       \"max_tokens\": 30, \"temperature\": 0
     }"

# Q3 (third question, also fuzzy-matches)
curl http://127.0.0.1:30000/v1/completions \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d "{
       \"model\": \"Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-AWQ\",
       \"prompt\": \"Who built JWST? ${ART}\",
       \"max_tokens\": 30, \"temperature\": 0
     }"
```

Each subsequent question pays the embed + ANN search cost (a few ms)
and avoids prefilling the article body again, since the chunks of the
article are matched against the donor's stored KV. The leak detector
remains silent across all three; verify with:

```bash
grep -c "pool memory leak detected" sglang-server.log    # expected: 0
grep -c "Fuzzy match success"        sglang-server.log    # expected: > 0
```

### Why this beats exact-prefix RadixCache

SGLang's stock `RadixCache` matches by exact token-id prefix. In both
cases above, the chat template (~24 tokens) is the only shared prefix -
the question portions differ at the very first non-template tokens, so
the article body is re-prefilled token by token even though it's
identical. `SemanticEmbedding` looks at the prompt's embedding rather
than the prefix, finds the donor on full-prompt cosine similarity, and
realizes per-chunk matches via N:M alignment.

### Notes for reviewers

- **Donor pool warmup**: cold-start deployments need at least one
  request through the system to register a donor before fuzzy match
  can fire. Production traffic patterns naturally satisfy this; the
  seed-then-variant pattern in these examples does too.
- **Per-chunk content alignment**: matching is at the chunk level
  (default `--fuzzy-block-size 16` tokens per chunk). Paraphrases that
  preserve content tokens inside chunks align better than paraphrases
  that shift token offsets significantly.
- **Threshold tuning**: `--fuzzy-semantic-threshold` controls
  embedding-similarity strictness; `--fuzzy-min-reuse-ratio` is the
  minimum chunk-overlap ratio required to surface a match. Lowering
  either increases recall but reduces precision.

## What's NOT in this PR (called out for reviewers)

- **Aggregate quality metrics (PPL ratio, ROUGE-L)**: paired-prompt
  side-by-side response samples are captured in
  `docs/quality_samples.md` and look substantively equivalent, but a
  large-scale aggregate quality bench is separate work.
- **Real-world dataset coverage** beyond longeval: triviaqa parquet
  pulls from xethub which is currently blocked from our EKS egress.
  scbench / narrativeqa runs queued.
- **A100 validation**: the runs here are on A10G for plumbing
  iteration. A larger-scale bench on A100 is a separate gate.
- **Larger-than-7B validation**: 13B / 70B not exercised in this run.
