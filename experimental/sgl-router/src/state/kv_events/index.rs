//! Lifecycle bundle for the KV-event index.
//!
//! Couples the three submodules that are independent in their own right but
//! always operate together in production:
//!
//! - [`HashTree`] — the cache-aware routing index keyed by SGLang block hash.
//! - [`EngineReportedLoadTable`] — engine-reported per-worker load.
//! - Two [`KvEventSubscriberRegistry`]s — one per `(worker_url, dp_rank)` on
//!   the cache topic, one on the load topic.
//! - A pump task that drains [`WorkerEvent`]s and applies KV batches to the
//!   tree and `Load` snapshots to the engine-load table.
//!
//! `add_worker` / `remove_worker` are driven from the worker manager on every
//! `DiscoveryEvent::Added` / `DiscoveryEvent::Removed`.
//!
//! # Race avoidance
//!
//! The pump runs independently of the lifecycle calls, so an event can sit in
//! the mpsc buffer while `remove_worker` is in progress. To prevent stale
//! events from re-inserting tree state for a worker that was just torn down,
//! [`KvEventIndex`] maintains a `live_workers` set; entries are removed
//! **before** the subscriber tasks are joined, and the pump filters every
//! event through this set before mutating the tree.
