## Motivation

<!-- Describe the purpose and goals of this pull request. -->

When we use logprob + streaming, tokenizer manager could hang because for every chunk, it re-process (`detokenize_logprob_tokens`) every token from the beginning. Say if we have 1000 tokens, it process 1, 2, 3, ..., 1000 tokens in each chunk. For each token (in the topk case), it creates a new python list which triggers GC and slows down and potentially hang the tokenizer.

Before the fix. The following could hang:


After the fix, the following will not hang:

## Modifications

<!-- Detail the changes made in this pull request. -->
Cache the already processed logprobs in request state so that we don't need to re-process them.


## Accuracy Tests

<!-- If this pull request affects model outputs (e.g., changes to the kernel or model forward code), provide accuracy test results. -->

## Benchmarking and Profiling

<!-- If this pull request impacts inference speed, provide benchmarking and profiling results. -->
